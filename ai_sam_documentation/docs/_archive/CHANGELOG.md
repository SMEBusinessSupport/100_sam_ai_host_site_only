## Summary

**What Changed:**
Hero section completely redesigned with Full-Stack positioning, dramatic dark design, visual stack demonstration, and SME business owner persona added as primary target audience.

**Why It Matters:**
Shifts messaging from "SAM is a smart chatbot" to "SAM AI + Odoo = Complete Business System" (Platform + Intelligence), directly addressing SME pain points of tool overload and lack of C-suite expertise.

**Impact:**
- **Clearer positioning:** Not competing with ChatGPT, competing with tool sprawl + hiring C-suite executives
- **Higher perceived value:** $1M+ solution → $99/month (vs. $20/month AI chatbot)
- **Better audience match:** SME business owners (target) vs. Odoo developers (niche)
- **Stronger CTA:** "Watch the Webinar" (education-first) vs. "Join Waitlist" (transactional)
